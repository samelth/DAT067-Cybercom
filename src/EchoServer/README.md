# EchoServer
This is a simple server that listens for UDP packets on a specified port and echoes all received packets.

When a UDP packet is received, its contents and the sender's IP address and port are printed to the console and an equivalent packet is returned to the sender. Input "end" into the console via stdin to close the server and exit the program.
